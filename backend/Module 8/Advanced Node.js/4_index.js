// Implementing Load Balancing with Node.js Cluster
// Description: Extend your cluster application from Question 8 to demonstrate basic load balancing.

// Steps:
// 1. Use Node.js cluster module from the previous setup.
// 2. Add a listening event to track the status of workers.
// 3. Make each worker listen on a different port for demonstration purposes.
// 4. Log messages to indicate successful setup and demonstrate the balancing of requests
// among worker processes. This kind of manual port setting is mainly for demonstration and
// would be behind a reverse proxy in a real-world scenario.
