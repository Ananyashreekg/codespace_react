// Basic Stream Setup
// Description: Create a basic readable and writable stream in Node.js and use it to read from `input.txt` and write to `output.txt`.

// Steps:
// 1. Use fs.createReadStream to create a readable stream from input.txt .
// 2. Use fs.createWriteStream to create a writable stream to output.txt .
// 3. Listen to the data event on readableStream to get data chunks and write them to writableStream .
// 4. Listen to end event to know when the reading is complete.
